# HikerHunger.app

A free, open-source, and ad-free app that helps you figure out if you're going to make it to the next resupply.

Or at least, without getting tooooooo hangry.

Built local first, so you can use it even when you're out of service.

## TODO

- [ ] So many unit tests, the calculator especially is suss
- [x] Didn't use stores like I probably should have, mostly because I didn't have a clear idea of what state looked like, so that may make some of the callbacks easier
- [ ] Store the data in indexed db
- [ ] Finish up the capacitor setup, it kinda works but it's not great
- [x] Charts! If they make sense, lol.
